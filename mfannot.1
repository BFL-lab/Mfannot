NAME
    mfannot - automatically annotated a genomic sequence
  
SYNOPSIS
    mfannot [options] masterfile

DESCRIPTION
    Mfannot is a tool to automatically annotate genome data stored in
    masterfile format. Mfannot uses a number of methods to annotate the given
    genome. First it identifies ORFs using Flip. A value for a minimum size of
    these ORFs is changeable. These ORFs are then blasted using blastp against
    peplibraries and/or pepfiles (the default contain mitochondrial proteins).
    Matches to the same protein which satify predetermined and user modifiable
    cutoffs and are located within close proximity are grouped together. After
    looking for a potential initiation codon, the genes are characterized.
    Exonerate is subsequently used to predict a internal gene structure by
    aligning the predicted gene and the reference protein (from the peplibrary).
    Another part of the programme uses RNAweasel and HMMweasel to detect RNA genes.
    The resulting annotation is stored into an outputfile in Masterfile format.
    
OPTIONS
    
    --ac, --addcomments 
              Add Comments
              If activated, comments are added in the masterfile.
              Default false.
    
    --allorfs
              Display the all orf, even those wich are overlapping with other
              annotations.
              Default: false.
      
    --all_introns
              Choose if only the introns who was not identified by Exonerate
              must be annotated by RNAweasel or if all introns must be annotated
              including those already discovered by Exonerate.
              Default  is 1 : introns annotated by RNAweasel add in comments.
              If value is 0 : introns annotated by RNAweasel not add in comments.

    --blast   Blast e-value cutoff
              This option allows the user to set the minimum signifiant e-value
              for ORF threshold.
              Default: 1e-10
    
    -d, --debug
              Use debugging mode. Print debugging information

    --el, --emptyorflen  empty ORF minimum length     
              This option allows the users to supply the cutoff value for an
              ORF (in nuceotide) they must be multiple of 3, which is found
              not to correspond to a gene.
              It will instead appear in the Masterfile as ncorf (non
              corresponding ORF).
              Default: 300

    --ext_config 
             It's a file used in order to call external programs. 
             Use for annotation of different genes like rnpB, rns and rnl.
             Default: '/share/analysis/control/mfannot/external_programs.conf'.
     
    --ext_select
             A list of names used to select or unselect which external programs
             to run (as specified in the --ext_config option above).
             The different names should be separated by a comma as in 'rnpB,rns',
             in this case ONLY the external programs needed to annotate 'rnpB' and
             'rns' will be executed. If you want unselect an external programs you
             must add no before the name of external programs : 'nornpB'; in this
             case all programs run except those specified with a 'no' prefix.
             Specifying a mixed set of 'no' and non-'no' programs has the same
             effect as specifying only the programs with 'no'.
        
    -f, --force
              This option allows more than one copy of the same gene in
              annotation.
    
    -g, --genetic       genetic code
              Genetic code used.

    -h, --help
              Display a help and usage, with syntax and options of the
              programme.

    -i, --inputfile inputpeptidefile(s)
              Peptide file(s) used for annotation of the masterfile. By default
              mfannot uses a collection of default peptide libraries. This
              option will override the default, and allow the user to name
              a specific library file of their choosing.
              See below for more information.

    -l, --logfile logfile
              This option allows the user to log the state of mfannot into a user
              chosen file.
    
    -m, --multiorfs
              This option allows more than one annotation for the same predicted
              ORF.
    
    --matrix  Matrix
              This allows the user to choose which alignment matrix is used
              during the blast

              BLOSUM45, BLOSUM50, BLOSUM62 (default),BLOSUM62_20, BLOSUM 80, BLOSUM90,
              PAM30, PAM70

    --maxis, --maxintronsize   Maximum intron size
              This option allows the user to modify the defualt maximum intron
              size (in nucleotides). During annotation, ORFs are grouped
              together to form a hypothetical protein. When this size is bigger,
              the gap can not be considered as an intron and the multiple ORFs
              form multiple hypothetical proteins.
              Default: 3000

    --mines, --minexonsize   Minimum exon size
              This option allows the user to modify the default minimum exon
              size (in nucleotides) that mfannot uses during internal structure
              prediction. This value should be an integer. 
              Default: 10
    
    --minis, --minintronsize   Minimum intron size
              This option allows the user to modify the default minimum intron
              size (in nucleotides) that mfannot uses during internal structure
              prediction. This value should be an integer.
              Default: 142

    --minorflen   minumum ORF length
              This option allows the user to choose the size of the minumum ORFs
              (in amino acids) that are produced using Flip. This value must be
              an integer.
              Default: 40

    --newrc, --newrcfile
              This option will create a file called '.mfannotrc' based on the 
              current selected and default options. If a such file exists, it
              will be replaced.

    --norc, --norcfile
              This option tells mfannot to ignore any existing rcfile should one
              exist in the current working directory.
    
    -o, --outputfile  outputfile
              This is name of the new masterfile to be created. The default
              output file will use the append '.new' to the end of the input
              file name. Should this file already exist, an integer will be
              appended to the end of the file, incremented by 1 from the
              largest number appended to existing file.

    --oc, --overlapcut  Overlapping cutoff
              This value is a cutoff that represents the permitted overlapping
              proportion of a non-corresponding ORF that overlaps a predicted
              gene in nucleotide.
              Default : 30
    
    -p, --pepdirectory  pepdirectory(ies)
              Path to the peptide directory containing peptide files. By
              default mfannot uses a collection of default peptide libraries.
              See below for more information. Peptide files must contain the
              suffix '.pep'.
              
    --partial
              Must be used when the genome his known to be partial or incomplete;
              this will cause mfannot to only run a subset of all its built-in analysis.

    --rc, --rcfile       rcfile
              Load the options presented in the file. By default mfannot will
              look for the file '.mfannotrc' in the current working directory.

    -S
              Do not search for genes proteins coding genes.
          
    --startbefore	
              The distance use to search start codon upstream the start define by blast
              Default: 10
    
    --startafter
              The distance use to search start codon downstream the start define by blast
              Default: 5	
    --strict
              Strict masterfile loading.
              Default: false
    
    --size	
              Use in order to define the size of the homologous protein.
              Use in order to put a Warning if the annotated protein is too 
              small or too large. The annotated protein must make +/- size%
              of the homologous protein
              Default: 5
    
    -t, --tagname        tagname
              This option allows the insertion of a user defined tag in each
              annotation made by the mfannot.
              Default: None

    --withmap [ svg | png ]
              This option requires an argument to determine the format of the
              graphic file which will be created. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
              format produces a file which is best for print, is scalable, and
              allows string modifications. PNG format produces a compressed
              bitmap image which is best for use on the internet, such as web
              page.
              The map option uses two programmes, mf2xml and cgview to produce
              a circular genetic map, and as a result may not be used on 
              masterfiles which include more than one contig. The map file is
              has the same name as the output masterfile, but with the
              appropriate graphics format extension.
              Default: No map produced.

MORE 
    Masterfile:
        The file given for input should be in masterfile format (ogmp web site)
        however, a file in Fasta format will also suffice. It should be noted
        that the output file will be in masterfile format. Mfannot is able to
        work with multiple contigs in the same masterfile.
  
    The input peplibraries or pepfiles: 
        The user can use several pepfiles and peplibraries. These should be at
        fasta format, and the files should be named in the following format;

                  eg F.asco.Podospora.anserina.pep
                     |  |       |        |      |
                     |  |       |        |      |
              Division  Phylum  Genus  Species  Pepfile Extension

        By using peplibraries, files inside must end with the .pep extension.

        Within the peptide file,  the headers of each sequence must be named
        appropriately, as follows;  
        
            '>(Genus species) (name_of_protein_without_space); comments'
        If the protein name (in one piece) is not followed by ;, it will not be
        recognized.

CONFIGURATION FILE
        Mfannot automatically searches for a file called ".mfannot" in the
        current working directory upon starting. This file can be used to save
        prefered command line options instead of writing them on the command 
        line at the time of execution.
        
        This file uses the same options as the command line except;
            -i,     --inputfile
            -o,     --outputfile
            -p,     --peplibrary
            --rc,   --rcfile
            --norc, --norcfile
            --newrc, --newrcfile

        The format to store the options are slightly different than the command 
        line options. Instead of a prefix of '-' or '--' no prefix is added, and
        if the option requires an argument, it is separated by an '=' as shown
        below : 
        
            option_name = value
      
        If no argument is require for the equivilent command line option (ie the
        presence of the option indicates a boolean state), the user must supply
        a value of 0 or 1, which is separated from the option by an '='. If the
        user does not supply an argument, the option is ignored. It is also
        ignored if the value is erroneous. Lines begining with '#' are
        considered to be comments.
