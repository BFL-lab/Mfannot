NAME
    mfannot - automatically annotated a genomic sequence
  
SYNOPSIS
    mfannot [options] masterfile

DESCRIPTION
    Mfannot is a tool to automatically annotate genome data stored in
    masterfile format. Mfannot uses a number of methods to annotate the given
    genome. First it identifies ORFs using Flip. A value for a minimum size of
    these ORFs is changeable. These ORFs are then blasted using blastp against
    peplibraries and/or pepfiles (the default contain mitochondrial proteins).
    Matches to the same protein which satify predetermined and user modifiable
    cutoffs and are located within close proximity are grouped together. After
    looking for a potential initiation codon, the genes are characterized.
    Exonerate is subsequently used to predict a internal gene structure by
    aligning the predicted gene and the reference protein (from the peplibrary).
    Another part of the programme uses RNAweasel and HMMweasel to detect RNA genes.
    The resulting annotation is stored into an outputfile in Masterfile format.
    
OPTIONS
    
     --blast  Blast e-value cutoff
              This option allows the user to set the minimum signifiant e-value
              for ORF threshold.
              Default: 1e-10
    
    -d, --debug
              Use debugging mode. Print debugging information

    --el, --emptyorflen  empty ORF minimum length     
              This option allows the users to supply the cutoff value for an
              ORF (in nuceotide) they must be multiple of 3, which is found
              not to correspond to a gene.
              It will instead appear in the Masterfile as ncorf (non
              corresponding ORF).
              Default: 300

    --ext_config 
             It's a file used in order to call external programs. 
             Use for annotation of different genes like rnpB, rns and rnl.
             Default: '/share/analysis/control/mfannot/external_programs.conf'.
     
    --ext_select
             A list of names used to select or unselect which external programs
             to run (as specified in the --ext_config option above).
             The different names should be separated by a comma as in 'rnpB,rns',
             in this case ONLY the external programs needed to annotate 'rnpB' and
             'rns' will be executed. If you want unselect an external programs you
             must add no before the name of external programs : 'nornpB'; in this
             case all programs run except those specified with a 'no' prefix.
             Specifying a mixed set of 'no' and non-'no' programs has the same
             effect as specifying only the programs with 'no'.
        
    -f, --force
              This option allows more than one copy of the same gene in
              annotation.
    
    -g, --genetic       genetic code
              Genetic code used.

    -h, --help
              Display a help and usage, with syntax and options of the
              programme.
              
    -i, --insertion
              This option allows the user to change the length of insertion in order 
              to report them.

    -l, --logfile logfile
              This option allows the user to log the state of mfannot into a user
              chosen file.
    
    --matrix  This allows the user to choose which alignment matrix is used
              during the blast. 

              Available matrix is this usually used by BLAST:
              BLOSUM45, BLOSUM62 (default), BLOSUM 80.
              PAM30, PAM70.

    --maxis, --maxintronsize   Maximum intron size
              This option allows the user to modify the default maximum intron
              size (in nucleotides). During annotation, ORFs are grouped
              together to form a hypothetical protein. When this size is bigger,
              the gap can not be considered as an intron and the multiple ORFs
              form multiple hypothetical proteins.
              Default: 3000

    --mines, --minexonsize   Minimum exon size
              This option allows the user to modify the default minimum exon
              size (in nucleotides) that mfannot uses during internal structure
              prediction. This value should be an integer. 
              Default: 10
    
    --minis, --minintronsize   Minimum intron size
              This option allows the user to modify the default minimum intron
              size (in nucleotides) that mfannot uses during internal structure
              prediction. This value should be an integer.
              Default: 142

    --minorflen   minumum ORF length
              This option allows the user to choose the size of the minumum ORFs
              (in amino acids) that are produced using Flip. This value must be
              an integer.
              Default: 40
    
    -o, --outputfile  outputfile
              This is name of the new masterfile to be created. The default
              output file will use the append '.new' to the end of the input
              file name. Should this file already exist, an integer will be
              appended to the end of the file, incremented by 1 from the
              largest number appended to existing file.

    --oc, --overlapcut  Overlapping cutoff
              This value is a cutoff that represents the permitted overlapping
              proportion of a non-corresponding ORF that overlaps a predicted
              gene in nucleotide.
              Default : 30
    
    -p, --pepdirectory
              Path to the peptide directory containing peptide files. By
              default mfannot uses a collection of default peptide libraries.
              Peptide files must contain the suffix '.pep'.
              
    --part_introns
              Default 1     : run RNASpinner in order to defined intron type 
              for all introns.
              If value is 0 : run RNASpinner only for a part of introns.
              
    --partial
              Must be used when the genome his known to be partial or incomplete;
              this will cause mfannot to only run a subset of all its built-in analysis.'
              
MORE 
    Masterfile:
        The file given for input should be in masterfile format (ogmp web site)
        however, a file in Fasta format will also suffice. It should be noted
        that the output file will be in masterfile format. Mfannot is able to
        work with multiple contigs in the same masterfile.
  
    The input peplibraries or pepfiles: 
        The user can use several pepfiles and peplibraries. These should be at
        fasta format, and the files should be named in the following format;

                  eg F.asco.Podospora.anserina.pep
                     |  |       |        |      |
                     |  |       |        |      |
              Division  Phylum  Genus  Species  Pepfile Extension

        By using peplibraries, files inside must end with the .pep extension.

        Within the peptide file,  the headers of each sequence must be named
        appropriately, as follows;  
        
            '>(Genus species) (name_of_protein_without_space); comments'
        If the protein name (in one piece) is not followed by ;, it will not be
        recognized.
