MFANNOT(1)            ORGANELLAR SEQUENCE ANNOTATION UTILITIES                MFANNOT(1)

NAME
  mfannot - make an Masterfile annotation
  
SYNOPSIS
  mfannot [options] masterfile

DESCRIPTION
  mfannot is a software for the annotation of organellar genomes stored
  on specific format file called Masterfile.	
  

OPTIONS
  -o        outputfile (or -outputfile)
              name of the new masterfile created. Default name will be old
	      masterfile name + '.new'
  -i        inputfile(s) (or -inputfile)
              Peptide file used for annotation of the masterfile.
	      By default, the programm will search the peptide file 
	      corresponding to the closest in the peplibrary. By default, 
	      the program will search in the local directory
  -d        debug mode (or -debug) 
              Give informations about programm processing
  -l        logfile (or -logfile)
              Print command and step processing in the log file. Default, 
	      don't print anything
  -p        pepdirectory(ies) (or -pepdirectory)
              Path for the peptide directory containing peptide files.
              If nothing, peptide directory is './'. 
	      Remark : To be inside the process of searching peptides files,
	      files inside the directory will be finished with '.pep'
  -g        genetic code (or -genetic)
              Genetic code used.

	      ---------------------------------
  -S        Without similarity search (or -nosimilarity)
              Boolean. If defined, no similarity gene search with peptide 
	      file for annotation
  -trna     tRNAscanSE utilisation (or -trnascanse)
              Using of tRNAscanSE for annotation	
  -flip     flip parameter 
              It's the minimum ORF size for annotation with Flip Blast correlated.
  -blast    blast parameter
              Minimum signifiant e-value for keeping ORF for annotation with Flip 
	      Blast correlated.
  -f        force annotation (or -force)
              Allows 2 copies of the same gene in annotation
  -m        multiples orfs (or -multiorfs)
              Allows 2 annotations for a same ORF.
  -rc       rcfile (or -rcfile)
              Load the options presented in the file
	      For running the programme
  -norc     No rcfile usage (or -norcfile)
              When the programme is running, it doesn't considerate a rcfile for
	      loading options
  -newrc    New rcfile generated (or -newrcfile)
              it will create a file called .rcfile
	      If a such file exists, it will be replaced
  -norf     No Orf.
              Allows the user not to run ORF process		      	
  -el       The empty ORF minimum length (or -emptyorflen)    
	      It's the cutoff value for an ORF, which doesn't correspond to a 
	      gene, appearing in the Masterfile as ncorf (non corresponding ORF)
  -oc	    Overlapping cutoff (or -overlapcut)
              The non corresponding ORF that overlaps more than the cutoff are 
	      not presented in the Masterfile
  -tc       tRNAscanSE cutoff value (or trnacutoff)
              Under this value, tRNAs detected with tRNAscanSE are deleted.
	      Default 20.
  -strict   Strict masterfile loading. (boolean)
              Default false.
  -ac       Add Comments (or addcomments)
              If activated, comments are added in the masterfile
	      Default false.
  -allorfs  Display the all orf, even those wich are overlapping with other annotations
              Default false
  -matrix   Matrix used for the alignement with genewise
              [ blosum62 (default) | identity ]
  -maxis    Maximum intron size (Or -maxintronsize)
              Integer. Default 3000 nucleotides
	      Under this size, 2 ORFs having the same potential name, are grouped 
	      together to form an hypothetical protein.
	      When this size is bigger, gap can not be considerated as an intron and
	      the 2 ORFs form 2 hypothetical proteins
  -minis    Minimum intron size (Or -minintronsize)
              Integer. Default 10 nucleotides
  -mines    Minimum exon size (Or -minintronsize)
              Integer. Default 10 nucleotides       
  -h        help (or -help)
              Display a little help, with syntax and options of the programms
  -more     more 
              Display more information about the programm


MORE 
 Masterfile :
  The file given in input. Should be at masterfile format (ogmp web site)
  Please note, the programm is able to work with several contigs (piece
  of sequence) in the same masterfile.
  Please note too, the input file can have annotations as masterfile format.
  
 The input peplibraries or pepfiles : 
  User can use everal pepfiles and peplibraries
  The pefiles contains the referee proteins to make the annotation
  The should be at fasta format. Specially the name of the contig, be 
  '>name of the specie name_of_protein_without_space ; more information'
  If the protein name (in one piece) is not followed by ;, it won't be recgnized
  By using peplibraries, files inside should ending with .pep extension.
