SYNOPSIS
    mfannot [options] masterfile

DESCRIPTION
    mfannot is a tool to automatically annotate genome data stored in
    masterfile format.

              ---------------------------------
    
    -h        
              help (or -help)
              Display a little help, with syntax and options of the programms

    -i        inputpeptidefile(s) (or -inputfile)
              Peptide file(s) used for annotation of the masterfile. By default,
              the programme will search the peptide file which corresponds to
              the closest in the peplibrary in the current directory.

    -l        logfile (or -logfile)
              Print commands and processing steps to a log file.
    
    -m        
              multiples orfs (or -multiorfs)
              Allows 2 annotations for a same ORF.
    
    -matrix   Matrix used for the alignement with genewise
              [ blosum62.bla (default) | identity.bla ]

    -maxis    Maximum intron size (Or -maxintronsize)
              Integer. Default 3000 nucleotides
              Under this size, 2 ORFs having the same potential name, are grouped 
              together to form an hypothetical protein.
              When this size is bigger, gap can not be considerated as an intron and
              the 2 ORFs form 2 hypothetical proteins

    -mines    Minimum exon size (Or -minintronsize)
              Integer. Default 10 nucleotides
    
    -minis    Minimum intron size (Or -minintronsize)
              Integer. Default 10 nucleotides

    -more     
              more 
              Display more information about the programme
    
    -newrc    
              New rcfile generated (or -newrcfile)
              This option will create a file called ".mfannotrc"
              If a such file exists, it will be replaced

    -norc     
              No rcfile usage (or -norcfile)
              When the programme is started the rcfile will be ignored if one
              exists.
    
    -o        outputfile (or -outputfile)
              This is name of the new masterfile to be created. The default
              output file will use the append '.new' to the end of the input
              file name. 

    -oc       Overlapping cutoff (or -overlapcut)
              This value has to between 0 and 1. 
              The non corresponding ORF that overlaps more than the cutoff are 
              not presented in the Masterfile
    
    -p        pepdirectory(ies) (or -pepdirectory)
              Path for the peptide directory containing peptide files. By
              default the peptide directory is set to the the current directory.
              Peptide files must contain the suffix ".pep".

    -rc       rcfile (or -rcfile)
              Load the options presented in the file
              By default it look for the file ".mfannotrc"
    
    -S        
              Doesn't annotate genes translated into mitochondrial proteins.

    -strict   
              Strict masterfile loading. (boolean)
              Default false.    
    
    -t        The user's tag for annotation (or tagname)
    
    -tc       tRNAscanSE cutoff value (or trnacutoff)
              Under this value, tRNAs detected with tRNAscanSE are deleted.
              Default 20.
    
    -trna     
              tRNAscanSE utilisation (or -trnascanse)
              Include the results from tRNAscanSE in the annotation.
              Note: This step with lengthen the duration of mfannot
              considerably. 

MORE 
    Masterfile:
        The file given for input should be in masterfile format (ogmp web site)
        however, a file in Fasta format will also suffice. It should be noted
        that the output file will be in masterfile format. Mfannot is able to
        work with multiple contigs in the same masterfile.
  
    The input peplibraries or pepfiles: 
        The user can use several pepfiles and peplibraries. These should be at
        fasta format, and the files should be named in the following format;

                  eg F.asco.Podospora.anserina.pep
                     |  |       |        |      |
                     |  |       |        |      |
              Division  Phylum  Genus  Species  Pepfile Extension

        By using peplibraries, files inside must end with the .pep extension.

        Within the peptide file,  the headers of each sequence must be named
        appropriately, as follows;  
        
            '>(Genus species) (name_of_protein_without_space); comments'
        If the protein name (in one piece) is not followed by ;, it won't be recgnized
